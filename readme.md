## Wiki ##
The intention of this project is to provide a modern, object-oriented wiki engine built on the Laravel framework.
To use the wiki, clone the repository and install the required dependencies with [composer]: <https://getcomposer
.org> "composer". To do this go to the root directory of the project using the command line and run the command `php
composer install`.  You will also need to set the proper file permissions for the app/storage directory so that
Laravel is able to write to it.
